# ConnectionManager

These projects are homework assignments and final projects for the University class: 715 - Distributed Computing.

Assignment1: Create a Message passing in a centralized environment using Java IO Pipes. A synchronous message passing between sender and receiver of primitives read from the InputStream.

Assignment2: Create a Message passing in a centralized environment using Java IO Pipes. A asynchronous message passing between more than 2 peers for both primitives and Objects.

Project1: Create an immaginary story of students that go to the college by bus, walking, and commuting. A Multithreading application where all these objects are threads that have to compete for the shared synchronized resources. 

Project2: Use of the Project1 in a Client-Server distributed system usign Java Sockets. The client run the thread that connect to the server by sockets and the server run the required tasks. Final output have to be the same of Project1 but ordered by the client and run by the server.
