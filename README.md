# ConnectionManager

These projects are homework assignments and final projects for the University class: 715 - Distributed Computing.

Assignment1: Create a Message passing in a centralized environment using Java IO Pipes. A synchronous message passing between sender and receiver of primitives read from the InputStream.

Assignment2: Create a Message passing in a centralized environment using Java IO Pipes. A asynchronous message passing between more than 2 peers for both primitives and Objects.

Project1: Create an immaginary story of students that go to the college by bus, walking, and commuting. A Multithreading application where the characters of the story are threads running their story and competing for the shared synchronized resources concurrently.

Project2: Use of the Project1 in a Client-Server distributed system by Java Sockets. The client run the threads which connect to the server by sockets, and the server execute the required tasks. Final output is the same of Project1 but requested by the client and committed by the server.
