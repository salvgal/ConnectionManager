# Connection Manager (Distributed Systems and Multithreading)

These are several projects developed to improve Distributed Computing in addition to multithreading systems. They implements Java Sockets & Pipes for the former, and Java Thread library for the latter. 

Project1: Create a Message passing in a centralized environment using Java IO Pipes. Synchronous message passing between sender and receiver of primitives read from the InputStream.

Project2: Create a Message passing in a centralized environment using Java IO Pipes. Asynchronous message passing between three peers to pass primitives and Objects.

Project3: Create an imaginary story of students that go to the college by bus, walking, and commuting. A Multithreading application where the characters of the story are threads running their story and competing for the shared synchronized resources concurrently.

Project4: Use of the Project1 in a Client-Server distributed system implemented by Java Sockets. The client runs the threads which connect to the server by sockets, and the server executes the required tasks. The final output is the same as Project1 but requested by the client and committed by the server.
